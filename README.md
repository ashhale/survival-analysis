# Final Project: Survival Analysis for Deep Learning
Ashley Hale

Due: 5/8/2020 midnight

### Purpose
Run the [*Survival Analysis for Deep Learning* tutorial][blog] using the supplied [Jupyter notebook][notebook].

Detailed instructions for running my version of the notebook are in the Final Project report. But the nutshell is:

  1. [Click here][ahnotebook] to open a copy of the notebook in your own Google Colaboratory instance
  2. Configure a GPU (optional but highly recommended)
  3. Run the first code cell to install Python package `scikit-survival-0.11`
  4. Restart the Colab VM via the menu *Runtime > Restart runtime*
  5. Continue with later code cells as usual

For additional information, please refer to the Final Project Report.
